== LLUDP protocol dissector ==
This is a Wireshark protocol dissector written in Lua for the Linden UDP protocol.
The dissector parses the message_template.msg file and use that information to decode all the message fields from the Linden UDP protocol.

== Installing ==
* Requires wireshark with Lua 5.2.x support. Tested on Wireshark 2.2.7

=== on Linux ===
* Copy the lludp folder into ~/.wireshark/plugins
* The other method is to add your user account to the correct group (on Gentoo it is group "wireshark") that will allow your non-root user to capture packets.

=== on Windows ===
* Copy the lludp folder into C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Wireshark\plugins

== LLUDP preferences ==
There are three preferences that can be changed from wiresharks "Preferences" dialog:
* Message template file: Full path to the message_template.msg file used to decode message name & details from the packets.  On windows XP/Vista use double backslash '\\' instead of single blackslash '\' to separate directories (Example "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\SecondLifeViewer\\app_settings\\message_template.msg"). A copy of this file is included in the disector; change this preference if you need to use another
* UDP port range start: First UDP port to mark as LLUDP packets. (default 13000)
* UDP port range end: Last UDP port to mark as LLUDP packets. (default 13050)

If your OpenSim regions are using ports 9000-9050 range then change the UDP port range.

== Description of source files ==
* "init.lua" -- Sets up http decoders on extra port ranges
* "dissector.lua" -- contains the code that decodes each packet header and decompresses zero-encoded packets.  This file uses wireshark only functions for accessing packet bytes and building a tree of information from each packet.
* "message_template.lua" -- contains the message_template.msg file parser the decodes the tokens from the lexer into an tree of tables containing all details about each message/block/variable from the template file.  This file only has pure lua code.
* "lexer.lua" -- contains the template file lexer.  This lexer knows how to tokenize the template file into the follow tokens: IDENTIFIER, NUMBER, COMMENT, EOL.  The stream of tokens produced by this lexer is parsed by the "llmessage.lua" file.  This file only has pure lua code.
